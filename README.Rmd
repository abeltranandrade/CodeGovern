# CodeGovern <img src="data-raw/hex_codegovern_US_colors.png" align="right" height=140/>

### Purpose
Code Govern is a package used to scrape, import, and download datasets and metadata from the website [Data.gov](https://data.gov/). This website is the federal government's open data site, and has over 298,424 datasets available to download in various export types (i.e., .csv, .xml, .json). Using **CodeGovern** functions, the data can be easily downloaded onto your computer, or for .csv files, return the data directly in RStudio. Our functions currently support CSV, JSON, and XML file types.

### Target audience
This package is intended for users who want to work with the open government data without having to repetitively download data and prefer not to work with the [Data.gov](https://data.gov/) interface. This package is also useful for those with domain knowledge who want to start working with data but want a more seamless experience given their limited experience.

### Installation

You can install the development version of **CodeGovern** as follows:

``` r
devtools::install_github("abeltranandrade/CodeGovern")
```
You can also clone the repository and install it through the Rstudio build panel. 

### Functions Included

The following functions allow the user to scrape and download data, **explore available datasets, and view data documentation (NEED TO CLARIFY THIS)**.

- `get_gov_file` downloads and imports a single dataset of type CVS, JSON, and XML

- `get_many_gov_files` downloads multiple datasets of type CSV and returns a list of data frames

- `name_crawler`

- 


### Usage

These are a few examples of how to use the package to scrape data from [Data.gov](https://data.gov/).

Load `CodeGovern` R package:

```{r}
library(CodeGovern)
```


**DO WE NEED TO HAVE THE import=TRUE here?**
```{r eval = FALSE}
#download the data set locally
get_gov_file("Electric Vehicle Population Data", "json") 

#download the data set locally and import it to the environment
my_data2 <-get_gov_file("Lottery Powerball Winning Numbers Beginning 2010", "csv") 
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
#Create a list of dataset names
my_names <- c("FDIC Failed Bank List", "Demographic Statistics By Zip Code")

#Download the datasets and import them in the environment
my_datasets <- get_many_gov_files(my_names, import = TRUE)
```

-------------------

I think we should remove everything below

### Dependencies/Setup
Need to load the following libraries:

```r
library(rvest)
library(stringr)
library("htmltools")
library("xml2")
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
library(rjson)
```

### Arguments

`name` is the name of the dataset you want to download. The name should be a string and should be worded exactly as it appears on the data.gov website. Example, "Lottery Powerball Winning Numbers Beginning 2010"

`type`: type of the data set. Must be a string. For example, "csv", "json", "xml", etc. 

`import`: Boolean that decides if file should be imported locally. By default it is TRUE and will import locally. Used mostly for internal processes. 


### Result
The function returns a downloaded data file that the user can assign to an object and import into the RStudio environment. The function currently supports only three file types: CSV, JSON, and XML.

- CSV: the function will download the file locally and return a data frame.

- JSON: the function will download the file locally and return the raw JSON file.

- XML: the function will download the file locally.

If the user enters any other file types, the function will put an error message and redirect the user to the website of the data.


### Examples

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(CodeGovern)
my_data1 <- get_gov_file("Electric Vehicle Population Data", "json")
my_data2 <-get_gov_file("Lottery Powerball Winning Numbers Beginning 2010", "csv")
```

### Phase III Package

In Phase III we will be working on the same package as in Phase II. Now, we have `get_gov_file` that downloads the data file. In the next phase, we would want to expand get_gov_file or create a sister function that is able to download multiple files in one function call through a vector argument. We will create a function that gives a catalog of the data sets on the [data.gov](http://www.data.gov) website through our function that will return the names. We will also work on a function that gives detailed information on the user's data set of choice, e.g., the date published.
